# Local User - Events

You can subscribe to various local user events. For subscribing:

- Implement `DyteSelfEventsListener` to a class say `LocalUserListener`, and
  listen to event from `DyteSelfEventsListener` by overriding them. This class
  can be user to manage your state in the application.

```dart
class LocalUserListener with DyteSelfEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onAudioDevicesUpdated() {
    /// code to handle onAudioDevicesUpdated() event
  }

  ...
}
```

- Now to subscribe, pass the instance of `LocalUserListener` class created above
  to `addSelfEventsListener()` method of `dyteClient` instance as follows:

```dart {2}
dyteClient.addSelfEventsListener(
  // LocalUserListener class instance
);
```

### Room joined

Triggered when the room join event completes and now the meeting is ready to
produce and consume media. At this stage, you can move to meeting room. While
implementing `DyteSelfEventsListener` we have :

```dart
@override
void onMeetingRoomJoined() {
  // When the local user joins the meeting room, this callback is triggered
  // We can handle the state here.
}

```

### Video update

Triggered when the user starts / stops the video using `enableVideo` or
`disableVideo`

```dart
@override
void onVideoUpdate(bool videoEnabled) {
  if(isVideoEnabled){
    // Video is enabled, other users can see the video.
  } else {
    // Video is disabled, others users can't see the video.
  }

  //  or alternatively you can pass the bool through state as demonstrated in example app.
}
```

### Audio update

Triggered when the user starts / stops the audio using `enableAudio` or
`disableAudio`

```dart
@override
void onAudioUpdate(bool audioEnabled) {
  if (audioEnabled) {
      // audio is enabled, and other participants in room can hear local user
    } else {
      // audio is disabled, and other participants in room can not hear local user.
    }

  //  or alternatively you can pass the bool through state as demonstrated in example app.
}
```

There are several other callbacks, that you can implement according to the
needs, here's a list of them:

- <span style={{ fontSize: '1em', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
    onMeetingRoomJoinStarted()
  </span>
  : callback when meet room join has started.
  <br />
- <span style={{ fontSize: '1em', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
    onMeetingRoomDisconnected()
  </span>
  : callback when meet room join is disconnected.
  <br />
- <span style={{ fontSize: '1em', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
    onMeetingRoomJoinFailed()
  </span>
  : callback when meet room join failed.
  <br />
- <span style={{ fontSize: '1em', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>onUpdate()</span>:
  callback when any update occurs in the meet room (example any other
  participant joins the meet).
  <br />
- <span style={{ fontSize: '1em', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
    onProximityChanged()
  </span>
  : callback when proximity of your device changes from body (as when phone sleeps
  when near your ears when on a phone call).
  <br />
- <span style={{ fontSize: '1em', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
    onAudioDevicesUpdated()
  </span>
  : callback when the audio devices are updated.
  <br />
