title: "Verify Webhooks Using Dyte's Signature"

Dyte verifies the webhook events it sends to your endpoints by including a
signature in the dyte-signature header of each event. This allows you to confirm
that the event came from Dyte and not a malicious server impersonating Dyte.

Perform the following steps to verify signatures.

## Obtain our public key

Our public key is available at
`https://api.cluster.dyte.in/.well-known/webhooks.json`. You can obtain it by
making a GET request to this endpoint.

```
curl -X GET "https://api.cluster.dyte.in/.well-known/webhooks.json"
```

## Check for the signature header

Every incoming request will have a custom `dyte-signature` header. This is the
value that you should verify in the next step.

## Verify the signature

The signature is based on the `RSA-SHA256` digest of the request payload. You
can calculate this on your end and compare it against the one supplied in the
header. If the two values are equal, you can safely consider that this request
indeed originated from Dyte.

### Sample code

<TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">

```js
const crypto = require('crypto');

app.post('/webhook', express.json({ type: 'application/json' }), (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['dyte-signature'];
  const payload = req.body;

  const isVerified = crypto.verify(
    'RSA-SHA256',
    Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(payload)),
    dytePublicKey,
    Buffer.from(signature, 'base64')
  );
  // ... do further processing
});
```
